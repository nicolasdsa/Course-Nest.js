/*
The selected code is from a file called [`update-user.dto.ts`] and it is written in TypeScript. This file is part of a project that uses npm as a package manager.
In this code, we can see an import statement at the top, which brings in the [`PartialType`] class from the `@nestjs/mapped-types` package. This package is commonly used in NestJS applications for working with DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
Next, we have a class declaration called [`UpdateUserDto`]. This class extends the [`PartialType`] class and takes [`CreateUserDto`] as a type parameter. The [`PartialType`] class is a utility provided by NestJS that allows us to create a new type that represents a partial version of another type. In this case, [`UpdateUserDto`] is a partial version of [`CreateUserDto`]
By extending [`PartialType(CreateUserDto)`], the [`UpdateUserDto`] class inherits all the properties and types from [`CreateUserDto`]but with the added flexibility of allowing those properties to be optional. This means that when using [`UpdateUserDto`], we don't have to provide values for all the properties defined in [`CreateUserDto`]"src/users/dto/create-user.dto.ts"). We can choose to update only specific properties of a user without having to send the entire user object.
This approach is useful when we want to update an existing user's information without requiring the client to send the entire user object with all the properties. It provides a more flexible and concise way of defining DTOs for update operations.
Overall, this code demonstrates the use of the [`PartialType`] utility from the `@nestjs/mapped-types` package to create a partial version of a DTO class for updating user information in a NestJS application.
